### Overview of features
 * Once the app is running, observe that you can not navigate to the `Dashboard` or the `Search` page unless you are logged in as a user

* User data is stored in `localStorage` initially and then as new users are added, it is persisted in `Redux`

* Navigate to the `Signup` page and create an account. You will then be redirected to the `Login` page to login

* Once logged in, you shoud be redirected to the `Search` page.

* If you search images, you will be able to "favorite" them. Navigate to the `Dashboard` to see the images you have favorited. You can also "un-favorite" images from the `Dashboard` as well


### Thank you and I look forward to discussing the application with you soon
